# AI Chatbot
The mission of the project was to convert a web-based consulting service into a chatbot-like feature. To achieve this, you not only need to understand the Natural Language Processing (NLP) but the most essential part, the creative mind for story designing.

Here are some snippets of the conversation between the bot and the user:

- __Modify the Submission__  
  As soon as the bot collects all the required information from the user, it will return all the values that user has inputed, allowing user to modify the incorrect information, if any.

- __Terminate the Procedure__  
  User can terminate the procedure anytime by expressing the stop intention.

- __Handle Chitchat__  
  Sometimes user may enter an irrelevant sentence, we call it "chitchat" or "unhappy path." The bot is able to handle these unexpected scenarios with a short response and pull user back to the question where they were off.
